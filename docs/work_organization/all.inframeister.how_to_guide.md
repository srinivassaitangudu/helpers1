## Overview

The InfraMeister role is critical for maintaining the operational health of our
infrastructure. This role entails proactive monitoring, alert management, cost
control, and specific oversight of infrastructure-related incidents.

## 1. Monitoring and Alert Management

### Review Alerts

- **AlertManager Overview:** Prometheus AlertManager, is a tool integrated with
  Prometheus to handle alerts sent by client applications such as Prometheus
  server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the
  correct receiver integrations such as email, Slack, or Telegram. It also
  ensures alert silencing and inhibition logic.
  - Regularly check alerts generated by AlertManager to identify critical issues
    that require immediate attention.
  - Evaluate alerts to determine their impact and urgency, prioritizing actions
    based on severity.

### General Approach to Critical Alerts

#### Immediate Response

- **Acknowledge the Alert:** Immediately confirm receipt of the alert to
  mitigate escalations and inform the team that the issue is being addressed.
- **Assess the Situation:** Swiftly evaluate the metrics or logs relevant to the
  alert to understand its immediacy and potential impact. For instance, if an
  alert indicates high CPU usage, immediately access the CPU usage logs and
  metrics on the Grafana dashboard to understand the severity (e.g., whether the
  CPU usage is consistently above 90%).

#### Diagnosis

- **Review Data Trends:** Analyze historical data to identify growth trends and
  potential points of failure. For instance, review historical data available in
  Grafana, to identify trends such as disk usage, memory leaks, or load patterns
  that can forecast potential points of failure.
- **Check for Anomalies:** Investigate any unusual spikes or patterns that could
  signify underlying problems, such as a sudden increase in response time or
  failure rates.

#### Mitigation

- **Implement Quick Fixes:** Apply temporary solutions if necessary to stabilize
  the environment while long-term solutions are devised.
- **Optimize System Performance:** Make adjustments to reduce the strain on
  resources, which could include purging unnecessary data or tweaking system
  settings.

#### Documentation and Reporting

- **Report Actions and Outcomes:** Log all actions taken and outcomes achieved
  in resolving the alert.
  - **GitHub:** Use for detailed incident tracking and resolution. File a GitHub
    issue or update an existing one with comprehensive details of the incident
    management process, including what was done, what was discovered, and how
    the issue was resolved or mitigated.
  - **Google Docs:** Maintain a running document for each major incident for
    real-time collaboration and information sharing during the incident
    response.
  - **Telegram:** For immediate communications and quick updates during an
    incident.
- **Communicate with Stakeholders:** Update all pertinent parties, including
  management and technical leads, about the incident’s status and resolution.
  Use our designated Telegram or Slack channels for real-time updates and
  discussions during active incident management. This allows for immediate
  feedback and quick coordination among the involved teams.
- **Conduct Reviews:** Hold post-mortem meetings if necessary to discuss the
  root cause and lessons learned. Provide updates during weekly sprint meetings
  with tech leads. Use this time for a more detailed discussion of recent
  incidents, resolved issues, and any lessons learned.

#### AWS RDS Database Alarms

- **Immediate Expansion:** If the database is critically low on storage (e.g.
  90% of capacity), temporarily increase storage capacity to prevent service
  disruption. Note that due to the nature of AWS RDS, any increase in storage
  capacity is permanent as AWS does not support reducing allocated storage once
  it is expanded. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the necessity
  of increasing storage.
- **Data Management:** Evaluate data retention policies and execute data
  clean-up or archiving strategies to free up space. For example, evaluate
  Kubernetes CronJobs or Airflow archiving tasks that automatically compress and
  move older logs and data out of primary storage every month, ensuring system
  efficiency and compliance with data policies.
- **System Adjustment:** Review and adjust the database configuration to
  optimize storage utilization and performance.
- **Long-term Storage Scaling:** Plan for scalable storage solutions based on
  the anticipated data growth and usage patterns.

#### Airflow Alerts

- **Test Stage DAGs:** Alerts prefixed with `test.` generally require no action
  unless specified.
- **Preprod Stage DAGs:** Investigate alerts through the Airflow UI to pinpoint
  the underlying issues, focusing on whether they arise from task failures,
  development glitches, or infrastructure problems.
  - If related to task failures or development issues:
    - Contact the responsible individual (e.g., Sonaal for DataPull DAGs, Nina
      for Trading DAGs).
    - File a GitHub issue detailing the problem and assign it to the responsible
      party. Use
      [Troubleshoot Airflow DagRun scheduling delay #8705](https://github.com/cryptokaizen/cmamp/issues/8705)
      as an example template for how to document and file these issues.
  - If stemming from infrastructure issues (e.g., Pod failures):
    - Coordinate with Shayan for resolution and follow-up actions.

### Refinement of Alerts

- Continuously improve monitoring tools and alerting mechanisms to minimize
  irrelevant alerts and enhance operational efficiency.

## 2. Infrastructure Incident Management

### Incident Response Protocol

#### Initial Assessment

- **Identify the Alert:** Quickly determine the scope and potential impact of
  the alert.
- **Prioritize the Incident:** Classify the incident according to its severity
  and potential impact on operations.

#### Investigation and Troubleshooting

- **Gather Data:** Collect relevant logs, metrics, and configurations that
  pertain to the affected systems.
- **Analyze Symptoms:** Correlate the collected data to identify patterns or
  anomalies that could indicate the root cause.

#### Resolution

- **Implement Fix:** Apply the necessary fixes or workarounds to resolve the
  incident.
- **Monitor Outcomes:** Closely monitor the system following the fix to ensure
  stability and that the issue does not recur.

#### Review and Documentation

- **Document the Incident:** Update the issue with a detailed incident report
  outlining the cause, response, and resolution.

#### Filing Infrastructure Issues

- **File and Track Issues:** Systematically file and track all
  infrastructure-related issues under the dedicated EPIC
  [Infrastructure Alert and Failure Resolution #9721](https://github.com/cryptokaizen/cmamp/issues/9721),
  and within the
  [Infra Project](https://github.com/orgs/cryptokaizen/projects/12). Use issue
  [#9606](https://github.com/cryptokaizen/cmamp/issues/9606) as an example
  template for documenting and filing new issues to ensure consistency and
  thoroughness.
- **Incident Report:** Ensure comprehensive report of each incident, including
  its impact assessment, investigative steps, and resolution measures.
- **Communication and Collaboration:** Work with relevant technical leads to
  develop and implement solutions.

## 3. Grafana Dashboard

### Dashboard Reviews

- Regularly analyze Grafana dashboards to assess system performance and health.
- Identify trends, potential bottlenecks, or anomalies.
- Suggest improvements or adjustments to dashboards to better reflect
  operational status and metrics.

- **Link to Grafana Dashboards:** Access the Grafana dashboards directly through
  [this link](http://internal-a56b0a7cf6e32459db6ba730e738f4f2-2134453936.eu-north-1.elb.amazonaws.com/dashboards).

- **Link to AWS Dashboards:** Review AWS dashboards for basic resource
  utilization metrics through
  [this link](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#dashboards/dashboard/RDS_EC2_Monitoring).

## 4. Cost Management

### AWS Cost Monitoring

- Check AWS billing and usage every Monday and Friday for any anomalies or
  unexpected charges. An anomaly is defined as any charge that exceeds a ~15%
  increase compared to the average of the previous three months' spending on the
  same service.
- Proactively suggest cost optimization strategies and implement approved
  measures to manage cloud expenditure.
- **AWS Cost Anomaly Detection:** Utilize AWS Cost Anomaly Detection to
  automatically monitor and alert on unexpected increases in spending. This tool
  helps in identifying and addressing anomalies in AWS costs without manual
  monitoring.
  - Regularly review alerts generated by AWS Cost Anomaly Detection which are 
    being sent to the `infra@kaizen-tech.io` e-mail address by the 
    [`Alert subscription`](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/home?region=us-east-1#/anomaly-detection/subscriptions/1ed10da2-d71a-4cd1-9de0-5e6069ee4081).
    The alerts are sent once a week if in that week there was a cost anomaly 
    which exceeded 15% and $120 above expected spend.  
    Analyze any detected anomalies in the `Overview` section of the 
    [`Cost Anomaly Detection`](https://us-east-1.console.aws.amazon.com/costmanagement/home#/anomaly-detection/overview?activeTab=history) 
    to determine their cause—whether they are due to expected changes in usage 
    or inefficiencies that need correction.

#### Issue Reporting

- File issues under the EPIC
  [AWS Cost Optimizations #8940](https://github.com/cryptokaizen/cmamp/issues/8940)
  and within the
  [Infra Project](https://github.com/orgs/cryptokaizen/projects/12) on GitHub
  for any significant deviations that warrant further investigation or
  evaluation.
